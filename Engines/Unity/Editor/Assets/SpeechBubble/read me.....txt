Using this Package you can make speech bubble as you want.

Here is the list of things that you can tweak(change) to make speech bubble appropriate as per your requirement..

===>In SpeechBubble.cs

1)"isPerspective" = If Bubble is Perspective then size will decrease as player moves away from camera.
   If Bubble is not Perspective than size will be similar to below variable "standardSize" regardless of distance with Camera.

2)"fixedWidth" = You can change maximum width of speech bubble via this variable. By default its width is 200 pixels.

3)"minDistanceFromCamera" = minimum distance from camera.. if player is nearer than this distance bubble will not be visible.. 
  I have kept this variable so that any bubble does not cover whole screen.

4)"pivotForBubble" = point at which buuble will be pointing. normally If you are using human character,
then this point will be player's top of the head.

5)"isBot" = If this boolean is false then the control will be in user's hand. he can move player and type message in textbox.
   If this boolean is true, then this player will move automatically and keep generating messages. to control this automation
   refer "PlayerMovement.cs".

6)"standardSize" = This size is refernced size of bubble proportional to its distance. Depend on this size,
   bubble size will be created dynamically.

7)"easeInAnimationTime" = Time for bubble fade in Animation.

8)"easeOutAnimationTime" = Time for bubble fade out Animation.

9)"bubbleLife" = Time that bubble stays in screen. If more than two bubble comes in screen then older will get deleted.



===>In PlayerMovement.cs

1)Only Bots(having "isBot" variable true in SpeechBubble.cs) will have this scripts. 
  You can control player's automatic movement in here.



===>In BubbleManager.cs

1)This script automatically generates players in this demo scene. You can control Instantiation in here.
